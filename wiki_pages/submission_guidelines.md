# Submission Guidelines

## Posters should ensure their post follows the below guidelines
---

### No generic titles

Provide a specific description of your problem in the title. Unhelpful, unclear or generic titles will be removed. 

To avoid "pleas for help" in titles, any title containing the word "help" will be **automatically** removed.

If your post pertains to a particular host application, please prepend your title with the name of that host application surrounded in square brackets (e.g [ACCESS], [EXCEL], [OUTLOOK], [POWERPOINT], [PROJECT], [PUBLISHER], [VISIO], [WORD], [AUTOCAD], etc).

example: `[EXCEL] How do I check if a cell is empty?`

A good title helps you get good answers. Bad titles generate few responses and may be removed.

Good titles are:

*  **Searchable** - This will help others with the same issue in the future find the post.
*  **Descriptive** - This helps contributors assess whether they might have the knowledge to help you.
*  **Short** - Use the post body to elaborate on the specific detail of your issue. Long titles are hard to read and messy. Titles may not exceed 150 characters.
*  **Precise** - Tell us as much as possible in as few words as possible (whilst still being a coherent sentence).

### Text posts must contain a concise and informative description

Empty or careless posts will be removed.

### Show that you have attempted to solve the problem on your own

Make an effort and do not expect us to do your work/homework for you. We are happy to "teach a man to fish" but it is not in your best interest if we catch that fish for you.

### List all errors and exceptions that you receive
  
**Don't**: Just say "I'm getting an error".

**Do**: Let us know the error type (Syntax Error, Runtime Error, Logical Error, etc) and provide an error code/description or provide a screenshot of the warning.

### Use the flair system

Set the flair to solved by replying to the answer with "Solution Verified".
Set the appropriate flair if not a question.

## Sharing/Posting Code
---

### Try to post actual code over screenshots
  
In general, if we need to see your code we are going to need to run it. Don't expect contributors to spend time transcribing your code from an image.

### Apply code formatting to code snippets

Use an opening and closing backtick (\`) to apply inline code formatting to a single line of code. Example: \`This is a single line of code\` becomes `This is a single line of code`. If using the Fancy Pants Editor you can select the text and click the ![<\>](%%sg-inlinecode%%) button. 
  
For code spanning multiple lines please format as a code block by indenting each line by four spaces:

    Public Sub HelloWorld()
        Debug.Print "Hello, World!"
    End Sub


If using the "Fancy Pants Editor" select all of the code and click the ![Code Block](%%sg-codeblock%%) button to apply code formatting to a block of code.

If using old Reddit or the markdown editor, paste the code into a text editor (VB Editor, VSCode, Sublime, Atom, Notepad++, etc), select all of the code and then indent the entire code block by pressing tab. Paste the now indented code back to Reddit. Old Reddit users with [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) can click the ![<>](%%sg-rescode%%)  button to automatically format any selected text as a code block. 

See the following links for more guidance on [Reddit-flavored Markdown](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown) or [Reddit comment formatting](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting).

### Use an appropriate hosting service to share large pieces of code

In an effort to keep threads orderly and readable, we ask that if your post requires you to share a large quantity of code (beyond what might be considered a "snippet") you use a hosting service such as [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) or [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/) and include the link with your post. 

As a rule of thumb, any code longer than 70 or so lines should be considered as exceeding a "snippet" and shared by this method.

### Sharing whole files

The sharing of whole files (such as an Excel workbook or Word document) should be considered a last resort and only done if previous attempts to solve your code have failed. 

**DO NOT POST ANY FILES YOU KNOW OR SUSPECT TO CONTAIN MALICIOUS CODE**

It is the responsibility of the poster to ensure that any shared files are sanitized of sensitive or identifying personal/corporate information.

Suggested free file hosting sites are:

*   [PixelDrain](https://pixeldra.in/)
*   [GitHub](https://github.com/) (Registration required) - **Preferred**
*   [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) (Registration required)
*   [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) (Registration required)
