Your post has been removed as it does not meet our [Submission Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/wiki/submission_guidelines).


> **Use an appropriate hosting service to share large pieces of code**

>  In an effort to keep threads orderly and readable, we ask that if your post requires you to share a large quantity of code (beyond what might be considered a "snippet") you use a hosting service such as [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) or [PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/) and include the link with your post. 
  
>  As a rule of thumb, any code longer than 70 or so lines should be considered as exceeding a "snippet" and shared by this method.


Please familiarise yourself with these guidelines, correct your post and resubmit.
