> **Apply code formatting to code snippets**
>
>  Use an opening and closing backtick (\`) to apply inline code formatting to a single line of code.  
  Example: \`This is a single line of code\` becomes `This is a single line of code`.
>
>  To apply code formatting to a block of code, indent the entire code block by four spaces or one tab:
>
>      Public Sub HelloWorld()
>          Debug.Print "Hello World!"
>      End Sub
>
>  If using the "Fancy Pants Editor" select all of the code and click the "Code Block" button to apply code formatting to a block of code.
>
>  If using old Reddit or the markdown editor, paste the code into a text editor (VB Editor, VSCode, Sublime, Atom, Notepad++, etc), select all of the code and then indent the entire code block by pressing tab. Paste the now indented code back to Reddit. Old Reddit users with [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) can click the "<>"  button to automatically format any selected text as a code block.
